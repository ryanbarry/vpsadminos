== Name

halt, poweroff, reboot - Halt, power-off or reboot the machine

== Synopsis

*halt* [_options_]

*poweroff* [_options_]

*reboot* [_options_]

== Description

*halt*, *poweroff*, *reboot* may be used to halt, power-off, or reboot the machine.
All three commands take the same options.

Care is taken to first stop all containers using *osctl shutdown*. As long as
*osctl shutdown* is running, it is possible to abort the operation using *Ctrl+C*,
i.e. sending *SIGINT* signal. See osctl(8) for more information.

== Halt reason

Unless option *-m*, *--message* is provided, *$EDITOR* is opened for the user
to write one. The reason is then written to syslog and sent to logged-in container
users as a wall message.

The default reason opened in *$EDITOR* can be extended by templates placed
in directory */etc/runit/halt.reason.d*. Non-executable text files are read
and appended, executable files are run with the following envinronment variables:

*HALT_ACTION*:: poweroff/reboot
*HALT_REASON_FILE*:: path to the file where the reason should be written

*$EDITOR* is opened after all templates have been appended or run. Halt reason
templates can be configured using vpsAdminOS option *runit.halt.reasonTemplates*,
see configuration.nix(5).

== Halt hooks

Halt hooks are executable files stored in */etc/runit/halt.hook.d* which are
invoked in different halt stages and can be used to run arbitrary commands.

The following environment variables are set:

*HALT_HOOK*:: pre-system
*HALT_ACTION*:: poweroff/reboot
*HALT_REASON*:: halt reason

Exit statuses of executed hooks are not evaluated.

Note that in the future *HALT_HOOK* can be extended with other hook types. It is
therefore recommended to always check its value.

Halt hooks can be configured using vpsAdminOS option *runit.halt.hooks*, see
configuration.nix(5).

== Options

The following options are understood:

*-h*, *--help*::
  Print a short help text and exit.

*-f*, *--force*::
  Forcefully power-off/reboot the system without asking for confirmation.

*-r*, *--reboot*::
  Reboot the machine, regardless of which one of the three commands is invoked.

*-p*, *--poweroff*::
  Power-off the machine, regardless of which one of the three commands is invoked.

*-w*, *--[no-]wall*::
  Send message to logged-in container users. Enabled by default.

*-m*, *--message* _MSG_::
  Message sent to logged-in container users.

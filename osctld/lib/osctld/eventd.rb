module OsCtld
  # Singleton event daemon
  #
  # This class aggregates events from osctld and announces them to subscribed
  # clients.
  #
  # == Subscribing
  # Clients can subscribe by calling {#subscribe}, which returns a queue over
  # which the events will be sent. To unsubscribe, call #{unsubscribe} with
  # the queue as an argument. An instance of {Event} is sent over the queue
  # for every reported event.
  #
  # == Announcing events
  # Events are announced using method {#report}. Events are classified by
  # a `type` and described by `opts`. For possible event types, see below.
  #
  # == Event types
  # === `:management`
  # Used for management commands received over the command socket.
  # Options:
  #
  #     {
  #       id: unique internal command identifier,
  #       cmd: management command,
  #       opts: command options,
  #       state: :run | :done | :failed
  #     }
  #
  # === `:state`
  # Used to report changes of container states.
  # Options:
  #
  #     {
  #       pool: pool name,
  #       id: container id,
  #       state: new state,
  #       init_pid: pid of the container's init process if it is running
  #     }
  #
  # === `:db`
  # Reports about changes in osctld database.
  # Options:
  #
  #     {
  #       object: pool/user/group/container,
  #       pool: object's pool name,
  #       id: object identificator,
  #       action: add/remove
  #     }
  #
  # === `:ct_netif`
  # Reports about container networking interfaces being added, deleted or coming
  # up and down.
  #
  # Options:
  #
  #     {
  #       pool: container's pool name,
  #       id: container id,
  #       action: add/remove/rename/up/down,
  #       name: interface name inside the container,
  #       new_name: net interface name when action is rename,
  #       veth: interface name on the host
  #     }
